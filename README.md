Motivation
This project aims to develop a predictive model for Tesla's stock prices using historical data, driven by the motivation to contribute to the field of predictive analytics and improve investment strategies. By analyzing and identifying patterns in historical stock price data, this project seeks to provide valuable insights for investors, traders, and financial analysts, ultimately informing data-driven investment decisions. Additionally, this project serves as a practical application of machine learning and data analysis concepts, making it an educational and skill-building endeavor. With the potential to identify key factors influencing stock prices and compare the performance of different modeling techniques, this project offers a comprehensive approach to understanding market trends and predicting future stock prices.

Problem statement
The problem statement for this project is: "Can a linear regression model be developed to accurately predict Tesla's future stock prices based on historical data, including open, high, low, and volume variables?". This problem aims to address the challenge of stock price prediction, which is a complex and dynamic task due to the numerous factors influencing market trends. By focusing on Tesla's stock prices, this project seeks to create a reliable predictive model that can inform investment decisions and provide insights into the company's market performance. The model's accuracy and reliability will be evaluated using test data, and the results will help determine the feasibility of using linear regression for stock price prediction.

Data Set

The dataset for this project is a CSV file named "Tesla.csv" containing historical stock price data for Tesla (TSLA). The dataset includes the following columns:

- Date: The date of the stock price data
- Open: The opening stock price
- High: The highest stock price
- Low: The lowest stock price
- Volume: The trading volume
- Close: The closing stock price (target variable)

The dataset may also include additional columns, such as:

- Adj Close: The adjusted closing stock price
- Adj High: The adjusted highest stock price
- Adj Low: The adjusted lowest stock price
- Adj Open: The adjusted opening stock price
- Adj Volume: The adjusted trading volume

The dataset can be obtained from various sources, including:

- Yahoo Finance
- Quandl
- Alpha Vantage
- Kaggle
- UCI Machine Learning Repository

Cleaning and Approaches

For this project, data cleaning involves handling missing values by replacing or imputing them, removing duplicates, normalizing the data to a common scale, detecting and removing outliers, and transforming data types as needed. Following data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to visualize and explore the data, revealing patterns and relationships. Feature engineering is then applied to create new features from existing ones, such as moving averages and technical indicators, and feature selection is used to identify the most relevant features for modeling. A linear regression model is trained on the data, followed by hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance. The model is evaluated using metrics like mean squared error and mean absolute error, and refined based on the results. Additional approaches include incorporating technical indicators, sentiment analysis, ensemble methods, time series decomposition, and ARIMA/SARIMA models to enhance the model's accuracy and robustness. By combining these approaches, the project aims to develop a reliable and accurate predictive model for Tesla's stock prices.

Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for this project involves visualizing and exploring the Tesla stock price data to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships. This includes plotting the stock prices over time to identify trends, seasonality, and anomalies, as well as calculating summary statistics to understand the distribution and relationships between variables. Distribution plots, such as histograms and box plots, are used to visualize the distribution of stock prices, while correlation analysis reveals relationships between variables. Time series decomposition separates the data into trend, seasonality, and residuals, and moving averages and smoothing techniques reduce noise and highlight trends. Technical indicators like RSI and Bollinger Bands are also calculated to identify potential trading signals. Finally, scatter plots and heatmaps visualize relationships between variables, providing insights into potential correlations and patterns. Through EDA, we gain a deeper understanding of the data, identify potential features and patterns, and inform the development of a robust predictive model for Tesla's stock prices.
